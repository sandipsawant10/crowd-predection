# Camera System Removal Summary

## Overview

Successfully removed all camera-related functionality from the smart crowd management system, converting it to a pure file-based monitoring system.

## Files Removed

- `dashboard/backend/src/models/Camera.js` - Camera database model
- `dashboard/backend/src/controllers/cameraController.js` - Camera CRUD operations
- `dashboard/backend/src/routes/cameraRoutes.js` - Camera API endpoints
- `dashboard/backend/src/services/cameraService.js` - Camera business logic
- `dashboard/frontend/src/components/CameraSelector.jsx` - Camera selection UI
- `dashboard/frontend/src/components/LocationMapView.jsx` - Camera location visualization

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes

- `server.js` - Removed camera route imports and registrations
- `crowdController.js` - Simplified all methods to return legacy endpoint messages
- `alertController.js` - Removed Camera model dependency, updated to support locationId
- `alertService.js` - Removed camera-specific socket rooms
- `socket.js` - Removed camera subscription handlers

### Frontend Changes

- `Dashboard.jsx` - Removed camera imports, replaced camera functionality with location simulation
- `api.js` - Removed cameraAPI exports and functions

## System Architecture Changes

### Before (Camera-Based)

```
Live Cameras → Camera API → Database → Dashboard
```

### After (File-Based)

```
External ML Processing → Results Files → File Watcher → WebSocket → Dashboard
```

## Legacy Compatibility

- Maintained API endpoint structure for backward compatibility
- Legacy endpoints return redirect messages pointing to new file-based endpoints
- Database models preserved but marked as legacy
- Alert system updated to support both locationId (new) and cameraId (legacy)

## File-Based Monitoring Features

- Real-time file monitoring in `results/` folder
- Support for `detections_*.json` and `forecast_*.json` files
- WebSocket-based real-time updates when new files are detected
- REST API endpoints for file listing and content retrieval
- Automatic cleanup of old result files

## Current System Status

✅ All camera dependencies removed  
✅ File-based monitoring active  
✅ WebSocket real-time updates working  
✅ REST API endpoints functional  
✅ Frontend updated for file-based operation  
✅ Legacy compatibility maintained

The system is now a pure file-based crowd monitoring solution that watches for ML processing results and provides real-time dashboard updates without any camera dependencies.
